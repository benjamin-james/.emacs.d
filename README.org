*** My emacs configuration
* Dependencies/concerns
*** Requires clisp, sbcl, or another Common Lisp evaluator for SLIME to work.
*** Also you need an emacs version capable of using ELPA (i.e. >= emacs 24).
*** So, you may need to update ELPA files. To do so, type "M-x list-packages" and press "U x" to update any needed packages.
