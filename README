INSTALL
Basically use the makefile.

At the end of installing quicklisp, press ENTER to confirm the installation.

Then, the rest of the files will copy in, and you can exit Emacs once it loads
after downloading everything.

DEPENDENCIES
Requires SBCL for SLIME and StumpWM to work.
For irony-mode in emacs, you need llvm, clang, and cmake installed also.
