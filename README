			My personal configurations

This has pretty much every configuration file for me.
You may want to clone this repository with
'git clone --depth=1 git://github.com/benjamin-james/dotfiles.git'
because its entire history is a few MB's.

Also, be aware that I have changed the keyboard layout which is now similar to
the Space Cadet keyboard. The details are in .config/xorg/Xmodmap. If you don't
like it, just comment out the line in .xinitrc:
[[ -f $usermodmap ]] && xmodmap $usermodmap

INSTALL
Basically use the Makefile.
When quicklisp is installing, you have to press ENTER to confirm the installation.
After the install is finished, start up Emacs to download and install all its
packages.
Then, in Emacs, type 'M-x irony-server-install' to compile and install irony-mode.
